            <h3>Modern Voting System</h3>
            <p>In the UK, a general election is held every 5 years where the members of the public who are over 18 and are not in prison can choose the government in power. In constituencies, people vote for the party they want to govern the county. The winning representative gets a seat in parliament for their party. The UK uses a voting system called First Past The Post (FPTP). FPTP is where a party running for government has to get 1 more than half the seats in the House of Commons (326) before they become the party in power. The leader of the party is usually asked by the Queen to become Prime Minister.</p>
            <h4>Proportional Representation</h4>
            <p>Other countries around the world often use the Proportional Representation voting system. This system is where people vote for the party they want to win and the party with the most votes nationwide wins. </p>
            <h3>Britain in 1820</h3>
            <p>Britain wasn’t as democratic in 1820 as it was very limited as to who could vote. Women, peasants and under 21s couldn’t vote. Only rich land owners could become MPs. When people went to vote there wasn’t a secret ballot like there is today. They would go to the voting station and tell the Land Owner’s workers who they wanted to vote for. The Land Owner’s workers would tick the Land Owner no matter what the voter said.</p>

            <h3>Revolutionising the Voting System</h3>
            <h4>Chartists</h4>
            <p>In the 1830s, a group of people called the chartists protested against the voting system they had. They believed that:</p>
            <hr>
            <ol>
              <h4 id="pc">The People's Charter</h4>
              <li>Every man over 21 that isn’t in prison should be able to vote.</li>
              <li>There should be a secret ballot to protect the person voting.</li>
              <li>People shouldn't need any qualifications or own any land to run for MP.</li>
              <li>MPs should be paid.</li>
              <li>There should be equal constituencies that are similar sized areas with similar populations.</li>
              <li>There should be a General Election every year</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>
            <p>Due to their first petition that had around 1.2 million signatures, the government brought out the Great Reforms Act which allowed anybody with an income of over £10 to vote. This just caused more anger as it blocked the poor from voting and let more rich people vote.</p>
